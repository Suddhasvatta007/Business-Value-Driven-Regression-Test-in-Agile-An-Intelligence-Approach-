# Business-Value-Driven Regression Test in Agile: An Intelligence Approach

This repository contains the code and datasets for a research project comparing four different algorithms for the constrained test case selection problem: a baseline Binary Constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (BCPSO), a Requirement-centric Genetic Algorithm (RTSGA), a hybrid GA with Hill Climbing (RTSGA-HC), and a purely Random Selector (RAND).

The project is structured to allow for the generation of synthetic datasets and the subsequent analysis of these datasets by each algorithm.

### Directory Descriptions

- **Algorithm Folders** (`Baseline/`, `RTSGA/`, `RTSGA-HC/`, `Random/`): Each folder contains the specific Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for that algorithm. The sub-folders (`124-40/`, `248-80/`) are designated output directories where the Excel reports generated by the scripts should be saved.

- **`Dataset/`**: Contains the input `mapped_dataset` files required to run the analysis scripts.

- **`Combined Visualization & Stat Reports/`**: Contains high-level notebooks for generating summary plots and performing rigorous statistical comparisons across all algorithm results.

## Workflow: How to Run the Experiments

Follow these steps in order to replicate the full analysis. Each step should be performed for both the half-size (`124-40`) and full-size (`248-80`) datasets.

### Step 1: Run the BCPSO Baseline

The BCPSO algorithm serves as the primary baseline for comparison.

1. **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to `Baseline/` and open `BCPSO Code.ipynb`.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute all cells in the notebook.
3. **Provide Input**: When prompted, upload the corresponding dataset file from the `Dataset/` directory (e.g., `mapped-dataset-248-80-defaultJS.xlsx`).
4. **Get Output**: The script will generate a comprehensive Excel report named `BCPSO_Statistical_Analysis_Report.xlsx`.
5. **Organize Output**: Move this generated Excel file into the appropriate output directory (e.g., `Baseline/248-80/`).

### Step 2: Run the Random Selection Baseline

This script establishes a naive baseline to gauge the effectiveness of the intelligent algorithms.

1. **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to `Random/` and open `Random Selection Code.ipynb`.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute all cells.
3. **Provide Input**: When prompted, upload the same dataset file you used for the BCPSO run.
4. **Get Output**: The script will generate an Excel report named `Random_Selection_Report_*.xlsx`.
5. **Organize Output**: Move this report into the appropriate output directory (e.g., `Random/248-80/`).

### Step 3: Run the RTS-GA Experiments

This notebook is designed to run multiple variations of the Genetic Algorithm.

1. **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to `RTSGA/` and open `RTSGA Code.ipynb`.
2. **Select a Version**: In **Cell 1**, you will find a dictionary named `GA_CONFIGURATIONS`. You can select which version to run by editing the `VERSION_TO_RUN` variable.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute all cells.
4. **Provide Input**: When prompted, upload the same dataset file used previously. The script will run 30 times for each budget level and may take a significant amount of time. It will save its progress to a `.csv` file after each budget is completed.
5. **Get Output**: At the end of the run, the script will generate a final Excel report named `Comprehensive_Report_[VersionName].xlsx`.
6. **Organize Output**: Move this report into the appropriate output directory (e.g., `RTSGA/248-80/`).
7. **Repeat**: Repeat this process for each of the GA variations you wish to test.

### Step 4: Run the RTS-GA-HC (Hybrid) Experiments

This notebook follows the exact same procedure as the standard RTS-GA.

1. **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to `RTSGA-HC/` and open `RTSGA-HC Code.ipynb`.
2. **Select a Version, Run, and Provide Input**: Follow the same steps as described in Step 3.
3. **Get Output**: The script will generate a `Comprehensive_Report_[VersionName].xlsx` file.
4. **Organize Output**: Move this report into the appropriate output directory (e.g., `RTSGA-HC/248-80/`).
5. **Repeat**: Repeat the process for all desired GA-HC variations.

## Advanced Analysis: Combined Reports and Statistical Tests

After you have generated the individual Excel reports for all algorithms, you can use the high-level scripts in the `Combined Visualization & Stat Reports/` directory.

### Final Plotting

- **File**: `final plotting code.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: This notebook loads multiple final report files (e.g., from BCPSO, Random, and one or more GA versions) and generates high-quality, combined comparative plots on a single axis. This is useful for creating figures for presentations or papers.
- **How to Run**: Open the notebook and follow the internal instructions. It will ask you to upload the specific Excel reports you wish to compare.

### Statistical Significance Reporting

- **File**: `statistical report code.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: This is the most advanced script. It performs a rigorous, publish-ready statistical analysis to determine if the performance differences between the algorithms are statistically significant.
- **How to Run**:
  1. Open the notebook and execute the cells.
  2. When prompted, upload the **raw data** Excel reports for the four algorithms you wish to compare (e.g., BCPSO, Random, RTS-GA V2, RTS-GA V3).
  3. The script will compile a single "tidy" dataset and then, for each time budget, it will:
     - Generate descriptive statistics and a box-whisker plot
     - Run a one-way ANOVA to check for overall significance
     - If a significant difference is found, it will run a Tukey HSD post-hoc test to identify exactly which pairs of algorithms are statistically different
  4. The final output is a comprehensive, multi-sheet Excel report containing all statistical tables and plots, with one sheet dedicated to each specific analysis (e.g., "BusinessValue_at_5pct_Budget").

## Notes

This structured workflow ensures that all experiments are reproducible and that the final analysis is comprehensive. For questions or issues, please refer to the individual notebook documentation or open an issue in the repository.
